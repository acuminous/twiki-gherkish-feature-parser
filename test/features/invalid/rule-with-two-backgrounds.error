I did not expect a background at test/features/invalid/rule-with-two-backgrounds.feature:13
Instead, I expected one of:
 - a blank line
 - a block comment delimiter
 - a scenario
 - a single line comment
 - a step
 - an annotation
 - the start of an explicit docstring
 - the start of an implicit docstring

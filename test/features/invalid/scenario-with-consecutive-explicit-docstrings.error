I did not expect the start of an explicit docstring at test/features/invalid/scenario-with-consecutive-explicit-docstrings.feature:8
Instead, I expected one of:
 - a blank line
 - a block comment delimiter
 - a rule
 - a scenario
 - a single line comment
 - a step
 - an annotation
 - an example table
 - the end of the feature
